# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat compile
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run --network goerli scripts/deploy_campaigns.js
```

# Truffle & Ganache
## the truffle folder contains the same smartcontracts for hardhat.
```
- truffle init # for new project only
- truffle create contract YourContractName # scaffold a contract
- truffle create test YourTestName         # scaffold a test
- truffle compile
```
